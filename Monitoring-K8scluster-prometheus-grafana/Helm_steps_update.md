## Prerequisites

- Since this Prometheus instance is designed to monitor a Kubernetes cluster, you must first provision the cluster using kOps. You can find the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/techlearn-center/DevOps/blob/CICD/Kubernetes/kOps.md) .

- Installing and configuring Helm:

Download the binaries, extract it and put it in /usr/local/bin/helm.

Change the directory to /tmp (this directory is designed for temporary file storage. Since it's often used for intermediate files during software installation or processes that don't require long-term storage,it's a convenient place to download and unpack binaries that you might not need to keep permanently):

```
cd /tmp
```

To install the binaries, download them using the following command:

```
wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.14.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary with the following command:

```
tar xzvf  helm-v3.14.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

We now have the Helm binary, and we will move it to `/usr/local/bin/helm`.

```
sudo mv /tmp/linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
```

```
cd
```

```
helm --help
```

After the cluster is provisioned and helm installed, follow the steps outlined below to install Prometheus and Grafana:

## Steps to Install Prometheus:

```
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

```
helm search repo prometheus
```

```
helm repo update
```

```
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
```

```
helm list
```

```
kubectl get all
```

- Now to make the service, which is normally only accessible within the cluster, available outside, we will be exposing it on each node's IP at a specific port. This can be helpful for accessing the service from external systems or for debugging purposes.

By running below command, Kubernetes creates a new service object that routes external traffic coming to each node on a specific port (assigned by Kubernetes if not specified) to the port 9090 on the pods selected by the original service prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus. This makes the Prometheus server accessible from outside the cluster.

Expose Prometheus server to external

```
kubectl expose service prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-ext

kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-ext
```

Alternatively, to assign your own specific NodePort instead of allowing Kubernetes to automatically assign one, you can use the --node-port option in addition to the command above. This option allows you to specify the exact port on the node's network interface where the service will be exposed.

However, you need to ensure that the port you choose is within the allowable range configured on your Kubernetes cluster (typically 30000-32767 for NodePort services, but this can vary based on your cluster's configuration).

```
kubectl expose service prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus --type=NodePort --port=9090 --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-ext --node-port=32000

kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-ext --node-port=32000
```

- To find out which node the prometheus-kube-prometheus pod is scheduled on, use the following command:

```
kubectl get pods -o wide|grep prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0|awk '{print  $7}'

kubectl get pods -o wide|grep prometheus-server-57b546f84f-5cql9 |awk '{print  $7}'

kubectl get pods -o wide|grep <input prometheus server name from kubectl get pods>|awk '{print  $7}'
```

- Now that you have the node name, navigate to your EC2 dashboard, search for that specific EC2 instance, and note its IP address.

- Additionally, make sure to edit the security group to allow traffic on the port that Prometheus is listening on.

- To find out which port Prometheus is using, you can use the following command:
  prometheus-server-ext

```
echo $(kubectl get svc prometheus-server-ext -o=jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
```

- You can now access Prometheus by opening your browser and entering the IP address and port in the format IP:Port.

## For example, use http://3.93.10.212:32531/ where 3.93.10.212 is the IP of the EC2 instance where your Prometheus pod is scheduled, and 32531 is the NodePort used for accessing Grafana.

## Steps to install Grafana:

```
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
```

```
helm repo update
```

```
helm search repo grafana
helm install grafana-main grafana/grafana
helm list
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc

***helm install grafana stable/grafana***

```

```
kubectl expose service grafana-main --type=NodePort --target-port=3000 --name=grafana-main-ext
```

To know which node the Grafana pod is scheduled on, use below command

```
kubectl get pods -o wide | grep 'grafana-main' | grep -v 'prometheus' | awk '{print  $7}'
```

- Now that you have the node name, navigate to your EC2 dashboard, search for that specific EC2 instance, and note its IP address.

- Additionally, make sure to edit the security group to allow traffic on the port that Grafana is listening on.

- To find out which port Grafana is using, you can use the following command:

```
kubectl get svc |grep grafana-main-ext|awk '{print $5}'|cut -d":" -f2|cut -d"/" -f1
```

or

```
echo $(kubectl get svc grafana-main-ext -o=jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
```

- You can now access Grafana by opening your browser and entering the IP address and port in the format IP:Port. For example, use http://3.93.10.212:32531/ where 3.93.10.212 is the IP of the EC2 instance where your Grafana pod is scheduled, and 32531 is the NodePort used for accessing Grafana.

- Your Grafana dashboard is now operational. To access it, please enter the username and password. To retrieve these credentials, use the following command: copy and paste as password. username = admin

```
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
```

- On the Home landing page, we can import data from several sources so we import data from our prometheus server.

By pasting the url of the prometheus server eg: http://52.91.99.89:32572/

- We can also import Dashboards: by using the respective id or url

Here are Grafana dashboard templates that you can import:

- [Dashboard 6417](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6417) or https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6417-kubernetes-cluster-prometheus/
- [Dashboard 3662](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/3662) or https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/3662-prometheus-2-0-overview/

- Import & select the prometheus data source option

- Use same clean up steps as used on kops cluster
